---

### 🖥️ Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/divyansh9876/AdGen.git
cd AdGen

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# 4. Add your OpenAI key to .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# 5. Run the app
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

> ⚠️ Required for script generation via OpenAI

## Deploy on Render

This repo includes a Render blueprint (`render.yaml`) and a `Dockerfile`. Puppeteer needs Chromium, so the service runs as a Docker web service and listens on Render's `PORT`.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In [Render](https://render.com), choose **New → Blueprint** and select this repository.
3. When Render asks for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, paste your key. It stays in the service environment and is not committed.

One-click blueprint:

[Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/divyansh9876/AdGen)

The free instance has 512 MB of RAM. Product scraping launches Chrome, so a busy scrape can run out of memory on the free plan. If that happens, move the `adgen` service to a larger instance.

---

## 🎬 How It Works

1. **Input**: Paste a product page URL (Amazon/Shopify)
2. **Scrape**: Puppeteer extracts product data
3. **Script**: GPT-4 generates ad script
4. **Video**: Remotion renders a 15–30 sec video
5. **Output**: Preview & download final MP4
